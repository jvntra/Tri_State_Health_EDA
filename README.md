#  Tri_State_Health_EDA

#### By Jean-Paul Ventura

This repository contains data collection, cleaning and analysis of public health data sourced from the 2018 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance (BRFSS) Survey that includes data for 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico.

# Project
Every year, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) conducts surveys to understand the latest demographic, health and fitness trends. 
For this project, I aim to analyze results of the 2018 report in order to provide recomendations and ask key questions.

# Structure of Repository

# Approach/Questions

1.) How does health status, represented by average number of days with bad physical health in the past month (PHYSHLTH), differ by state and are there indications of the relative distributions state-by-state?
2.) What are some factors that impact health (i.e.demographics, behaviors, previous illness etc?))

# Data 

1.) Our data includes records for the USA but only data for the Tri-state Area are considered.
2.) Data in this repository are not API sourced. Please keep in mind if you hope to replicate these analyses.
3.) A codebook with state codes and data descriptions are available [here](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/2018/pdf/codebook18_llcp-v2-508.pdf)
